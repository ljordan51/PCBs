AIL/Precharge - Controls and powers accumulator indicator light with the high voltage (HV) part of the car in order to switch on an LED when the high voltage system on the car reaches 60V. Circuit is designed to be able to function up to 300V (max pack voltage). Currently turns light on at 35V due to the characteristic of the LDO but this issue could be solved by adding a 20-25V Zener diode before the LDO. Additionally, the board contains the precharge circuit which charges the capacitive load of the motor controller before closing the accumulator isolation relays connecting the battery to the rest of the HV circuit.

TSAL - Controls (with HV) and powers (with grounded low voltage (GLV)) the tractive system active light in order to switch on a super bright, flashing indicator light when the high voltage system on the car reaches 60V. Circuit is designed to be able to function up to 300V (max pack voltage). The light must be controlled by the HV but powered by the GLV due to the high current draw.

MSPM - The master switch panel monitor uses an ATmega microcontroller and shutdown sensing transistors in order to communicate which points in the shutdown circuit are receiving GLV and send that information through CAN messaging to the dashboard.
